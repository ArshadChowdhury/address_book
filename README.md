# This is a simple address book app built with jQuery, HTML/CSS.
### This task was given in an interview, they asked me to do it in jQuery, although I didn't work that much on jQuery I had some help from internet & managed to do it all by myself. This has a working search as well which sorts only the searched letters and filters accordingly
